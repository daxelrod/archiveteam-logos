Various versions of the ArchiveTeam logo, suitable for different contexts. See the various branches for more:

  * no-badge: Only the imagery, no text or oval border
  * icon-large: 128x128 icon version of the logo
  * icon-small: 64x64, 32x32 and 16x16 versions of the logo (without cloud)

Note that I did not create the original version this logo, and do not claim authorship for it.


The Archiveteam_logo_layers directory
-------------------------------------

PNG does not support layers. In addition to the Paint.net .pdn file, and a flattened PNG, I've provided a
directory with individual pngs of each layer. Lowest number corresponds to lowest layer in the
stacking order.
